Project codename: **3F1 (Three-Faction-Intelligence)**

Goal:
Build a minimal+fun website where **three AI agents debate a topic** given by the user.

Requirements:
- User can input:
  - Agent 1 / Agent 2 / Agent 3
  - Provider (ChatGPT / Gemini / Perplexity / Custom API endpoint)
  - Model/version (e.g., gpt-4o, gemini-2.0-pro, etc.)
  - API Keys (masked input fields)
- User enters a debate topic
- System auto-runs a **debate of 5 turns per agent** (15 total messages):
  - Each agent MUST read/analyze previous messages
  - Must explicitly reference another agent’s argument in each response
  - Must progressively explore multiple perspectives
  - Final round ends with a **clear “Oppose the motion” stance**
- After debate completes:
  - Show transcript live on screen
  - Provide a **Download transcript (.txt or .json)** button

Style/UI:
- Minimal UI, playful tone (Perplexity vibes but simpler)
- Block-font **3F1** logo displayed at top
- Light theme, clean layout, subtle animations (slide/fade on each message)
- Funny microcopy ("Let the robots argue 🥲")

Technology (strictly follow this):
- Backend: Node.js + Express
  - `server.js` handles proxies to different AI providers
  - Create simple adapters (`/lib/openai.js`, `/lib/gemini.js`, `/lib/generic.js`)
- Frontend: Single-page web app
  - Can be React or HTML/JS — prioritize minimal simplicity
  - Form: 3 agent blocks + topic input + Start button
- No database — do not store API keys persistently
- Transcript export feature required

Backend Orchestration Logic:
- `debateOrchestrator.js`
  - Loop 5 rounds
  - For each round, call Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
  - Include prior messages as conversation context
  - Trim context if token size too large (summaries ok)
  - Agents MUST reference previous arguments

System prompt template for each agent (use in code):

“You are <AGENT_NAME> (<PROVIDER>, model <MODEL>). Each time you speak:
1) Read conversation history and quote at least one message from another agent.
2) Rebut, extend, or challenge the argument logically.
3) Offer a new perspective that hasn’t been mentioned yet.
4) At round 5, provide a closing summary AND a clear ‘Oppose the motion’ stance.”

Output format needed:
- Live feed on screen
- Download transcript JSON file containing:
